# Defra Ruby Mocks

A Rails Engine used by the [Ruby services team](https://github.com/DEFRA/ruby-services-team) in their digital services.

We use it to mock external services such as Companies House, so we can performance test our services and not get in trouble!

When mounted in an app, it will add additional endpoints which when called will 'mock' the functionality of the external service.

Things to note

- We have gone with an engine rather than an additional service, to simplify management of mocking in our environments
- The mocks do not replicate all functionality an external service provides, only the features we use in our services

## Prerequisites

Make sure you already have:

- Ruby 2.4.2
- [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) â€“ for installing Ruby gems

# Mounting the engine

Add the engine to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "defra_ruby_mocks",
    git: "https://github.com/DEFRA/defra-ruby-mocks"
```

Install it with `bundle install`.

Then mount the engine in your routes.rb file:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  mount DefraRuby::Mocks::Engine => "/"
end
```

The engine should now be mounted at the root of your project. You can change `"/"` to a different route if you'd prefer it to be in a subdirectory.

## Installation

You don't need to do this if you're just mounting the engine without making any changes.

However, if you want to edit the engine, you'll have to install it locally.

Clone the repo and drop into the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DEFRA/defra-ruby-mocks.git && cd defra-ruby-mocks
```

Then install the dependencies with `bundle install`.

## Testing the engine

The engine is mounted in a dummy Rails 4 app (in /spec/dummy) so we can properly test its behaviour.

The test suite is written in RSpec.

To run all the tests, use `bundle exec rspec`.
