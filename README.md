A Rails Engine used by the [Ruby services team](https://github.com/DEFRA/ruby-services-team) in their digital services.

We use it to mock external services such as Companies House, so we can performance test our services and not get in trouble!

When mounted in an app, it will add additional endpoints which when called will 'mock' the functionality of the external service.

Things to note

- We have gone with an engine rather than an additional service, to simplify management of mocking in our environments
- The mocks do not replicate all functionality an external service provides, only the features we use in our services

## Prerequisites

Make sure you already have:

- Ruby 2.7.1
- [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) â€“ for installing Ruby gems

## Mounting the engine

Add the engine to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "defra_ruby_mocks",
    git: "https://github.com/DEFRA/defra-ruby-mocks"
```

Install it with `bundle install`.

Then mount the engine in your routes.rb file:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  mount DefraRubyMocks::Engine => "/mocks"
end
```

The engine should now be mounted at `/mocks` of your project. You can change `"/mocks"` to a different route if you'd prefer it to be elsewhere.

## Configuration

For the mock routes to be accessible you'll also need to enable them.

```ruby
# config/initializers/defra_ruby_mocks.rb
require "defra_ruby_mocks"

DefraRubyMocks.configure do |config|
  config.enable = true
  config.delay = 1000
end
```

To protect against having them enabled when in production, by default the engine will not allow access unless they have been enabled in the config.

We also provide an option to control how long the mock should delay before responding. The default is 1000ms (1 second).

## Mocks

The project currently mocks the following services.

### Companies House

When mounted into an app you can make requests to `/mocks/company/[company number]` to get a response that matches what our apps expect.

This is an important distinction to note. When our apps like the [Waste Exemptions front office](https://github.com/DEFRA/waste-exemptions-front-office) make a real request to Companies House, they get a lot more information back in the JSON reponse. However the only things they are interested in are the value of `"company_name"`, `"company_status"`, `"company_type"` and `"registered_office"`, .

So rather than maintain a lot of unused JSON data, the mock just returns those bits of the JSON.

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/mocks/company/SC123456
{
    "company_name": "Acme Industries",
    "company_status": "active",
    "company_type": "ltd",
    "registered_office_address": {
        "address_line_1": "10 Downing St",
        "address_line_2": "Horizon House",
        "locality": "Bristol",
        "postal_code": "BS1 5AH"
    }
}
```

Additionally, an Officers endpoint is available at `/mocks/company/[company number]/officers`. This returns a list of partial Officer data, eg:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/mocks/company/SC123456/officers
{
   "items": [
    {
      "name": "APPLE, Alice",
      "officer_role": "director"
    },
    {
      "name": "BANANA, Bob",
      "officer_role": "director"
    },...
}
```

#### Company numbers

As long as the request is for a valid number the mock will return the status as `"active"`. (see <https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/426891/uniformResourceIdentifiersCustomerGuide.pdf> for details of valid number formats).

The exceptions to this are the 'special' numbers listed below. Use them if you are looking for alternate responses.

- `05868270` will return `"dissolved"`
- `04270505` will return `"administration"`
- `99999999` will mock a not found result and return a 404 error
- `88888888` will return `"liquidation"`
- `77777777` will return `"receivership"`
- `66666666` will return `"converted-closed"`
- `55555555` will return `"voluntary-arrangement"`
- `44444444` will return `"insolvency-proceedings"`
- `33333333` will return `"open"`
- `22222222` will return `"closed"`

Additionally, an `"active"` LLP company can be retrieved by using the following registration numbers:

- `XX999999`
- `YY999999`

The list of possible statuses was taken from

- [Companies House API](https://developer.companieshouse.gov.uk/api/docs/company/company_number/companyProfile-resource.html)
- [Companies House API enumerations](https://github.com/companieshouse/api-enumerations/blob/master/constants.yml)

### Govpay

When mounted into an app you can simulate interacting with the Govpay hosted pages service.

#### Payments

Making a payment with Govpay essentially comes in 2 stages

1. The app sends a JSON request to Govpay asking it to prepare for a new payment, and providing a unique identifier and a callback URL.
2. Govpay subsequently invokes the callback URL, passing a Govpay URL to which the user should be redirected.
2. The app redirects the user to the Govpay URL with params that tell Govpay where to redirect the user to when the payment is complete.

This Govpay mock replicates those 2 interactions with the following url
- `../govpay/v1/payments`

#### Configuration

In order to use the govpay mock you'll need to provide additional configuration details

```ruby
# config/initializers/defra_ruby_mocks.rb
require "defra_ruby_mocks"

DefraRubyMocks.configure do |config|
  config.govpay_domain = File.join(ENV["WCRS_GOVPAY_DOMAIN"] || "http://localhost:3002", "/fo/mocks/govpay/v1")
end
```

The domain is used when generating the URL we tell the app to redirect users to. As this is just an engine and not a standalone service, we need to tell it what domain it is running from.

```ruby
mount DefraRubyMocks::Engine => "/mocks"
```

#### Only for Waste Carriers

At this time there is only one digital service built using Ruby on Rails that uses Govpay; the [Waste Carriers Registration service](https://github.com/DEFRA/ruby-services-team/tree/master/services/wcr). So the Govpay mock has been written with the assumption it will only be mounted into one of the Waste Carriers apps.

A critical aspect of this is the expectation that the following classes will be loaded and available when the engine is mounted and the app is running

- `WasteCarriersEngine::TransientRegistration`
- `WasteCarriersEngine::Registration`

#### Payment pages are not mocked

The actual Govpay service presents payment pages that display a form where users are able to enter their credit card details and confirm the payment is correct. This mock does **not** replicate the UI of Govpay, only the API. Bear this in mind when building any automated acceptance tests.

## Installation

You don't need to do this if you're just mounting the engine without making any changes.

However, if you want to edit the engine, you'll have to install it locally.

Clone the repo and drop into the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DEFRA/defra-ruby-mocks.git && cd defra-ruby-mocks
```

Then install the dependencies with `bundle install`.

## Testing the engine

The engine is mounted in a dummy Rails 4 app (in /spec/dummy) so we can properly test its behaviour.

The test suite is written in RSpec.

To run all the tests, use `bundle exec rspec`.
